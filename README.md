# Data-Structures
In this repository I've learnt & coded the different data structures in Computer Science using Java.
A data structrure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. 
There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.
Throughout the journey it was also useful to explore and understand complexity analysis to see why these various structures could be more efficient

In working on this repository I have studied and put to use the following Data Structures:
<p>
  *Arrays
   - 1 Dimensional
   - 2 Dimensional

  *Linked Lists
   - Single & Doubly Linked
   - Circular Lists
   - Skip Lists
   - Self Organizing Lists
   - Sparse Table
  
  *Stacks And Queues
   - Priority Queues etc
   - Popping & Dequeing
   
  *Binary Trees
   - Traversal
   - Insertion
   - Deletion
   - Balancing
   - Heaps
   - Treaps
   - kd Trees
   
  *Multiway Trees

   -B* Trees
   -B+ Trees
   -Prefix B+ Trees
